\subsection*{Problem 1: Interface}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] When specifying the detailed interface, several things are needed. One of those things are the messages. 
\item[Reason] The messages is for example the data involved, how the message is identified or event communicated.  
\item[Correct answer] A (\textit{Both the proposition and the reason are correct statements,
AND the reason explains the proposition in a correct way.})
\item[Motivation]  The proposition is true as there are four things mentioned in Lau needed to be specified the detailed interface. These are the physical channel, the message, the protocol and the semantics. The reason is also true since those questions are presented to let the user know what Lau means by "The message" in the book.

\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] Project inception is included in the product life cycle of the requirements. 
\item[Reason] This is needed let the customer specify how he measures the requirements. 
\item[Correct answer] C (\textit{The proposition is true, but the reason is false.})
\item[Motivation] The proposition is true, since this is where question such as what should be included/excluded, advantages of the system, who is affected and many more vague issues are stated. The reason is false since that is relating to the part "Rating the requirements" rather than "inception".

\section*{Chapter 6, QUPER}
\subsection*{Problem 2: TITLE OF PROBLEM}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] The quality grid can be used to weed out unimportant quality factors of the project before writing requirements.
\item[Reason] It's a grid with intersections of criticality and quality factors, e.g Reliability : Important, Correctness : Ignore.
\item[Correct answer] A (\textit{Both the proposition and the reason are correct statements,
AND the reason explains the proposition in a correct way.})
\item[Motivation] The reason is true because that is a general description of a quality grid. The result of the quality grid is then the answer to the question "How important is this quality factor for my project?" which means that the proposition is true.

\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] Open target or open metric should never be used for design-level requirements. 
\item[Reason] The customer should not be concerned about details on the design level. 
\item[Correct answer] E (\textit{Both the proposition and the reason are false})
\item[Motivation] The proposition is false because even if the results of an open target or open metric is not reasonable, they can still be discussed after. The reason is false because the customer might have valuable knowledge about the domain.

\subsection*{Problem 4: TITLE OF PROBLEM}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] In practice, Unambiguous specs are one of the biggest problems. 
\item[Reason] If a developer does not understand an requirement, he/she normally just guess what the customer wants.
\item[Correct answer] E
\item[Motivation] Unambiguous specs are not a big problem in practice because developers normally ask customers to clarify. It can be a problem if the developer believes he knows, even though the customer wants something else. However, it is normally not a big problem.

\subsection*{Problem 4: TITLE OF PROBLEM}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] Using checklists for content checks can be a good idea.
\item[Reason] A checklist is a way of reminding you what should be in the spec.
\item[Correct answer] A
\item[Motivation] A content check, looks at the content to make sure everything is in there. Checklists can be used to check that the spec contains what should be in it. You can check of one item at a time.

\subsection*{Problem : MDRE}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] Fulfilling contracts is the most important aspect of MDRE.
\item[Reason] Fulfilling contracts may increase costumer satisfaction. 
\item[Correct answer] D
\item[Motivation] In MDRE the primary task is to deliver a product that costumer wants in time and often don't have a contract with costumer beforehand.

\subsection*{Problem : 100\$}
\begin{description} 
\item[Proposition] It's recommended to use 100\$ method iterative.
\item[Reason] The stakeholders will distribute the money more as their real prioritization after each iteration.  
\item[Correct answer] E
\item[Motivation] Some stakeholders may try to focus on something that is only useful for themselves when they know that other requirements will get money regardless.

\section*{AGRE, INTDEP}
\subsection*{Problem : Interdependencies}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] The time and effort required to do pairwise assessment of requirements (i.e. finding possible interdependencies between them) is constant no matter how many requirements one have to assess. 
\item[Reason] Identifying singular requirements can reduce the time and effort needed to do pairwise assessment of a set of requirements. 
\item[Correct answer] D (The proposition is false, but the reason is a true statement)
\item[Motivation] The time and effort needed heavily increases with the number of requirements. The number of assessments are 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{1}^{n-1}i = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} 
\end{equation}
where n is number of requirements. The proposition is therefore false. The reason is a true statement though, since finding the singular requirements usually is a fast and easy task and then the number of assessments are reduced to
\begin{equation}
\sum_{1}^{n-1-s}i = \frac{(n-s)(n-1-s)}{2} 
\end{equation}
The reason is therefore a true statement.

\subsection*{Problem : Agile RE}
\begin{description}
\item[Proposition] Face-to-face communication between and customer and the team is very common in an agile development project.
\item[Reason] Benefits of face-to-face communication are: 1. Customer can steer the project in new directions. 2. Removes need for time-consuming documentation and approval processes.
\item[Correct answer] A (Both the proposition and the reason are correct statements, AND the reason explains the proposition in a correct way.)
\item[Motivation] According to the article, all 16 organizations rely heavily on face-to-face communication, the proposition is true. The reasons were reported by the participants, therefore the statement is true and explains the proposition in a correct way.
