%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%----------------- System Requirements ------------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Different types of system requirements (e.g. data, function, quality) at different levels (e.g. goal, domain, product, design).
% Each requirement should have a unique identity (name or number) that is consistent between releases.
% A subset of the requirements should be prioritized.

% 3A) more than two types of requirement (e.g. data, function, quality), and more than three abstraction levels (e.g. goal, domain, product, design) 
% 4A) combine different degrees of completeness and different levels of abstraction
% 4C) provide explicit requirements rationale that reduce risks of misinterpretation.
% 4D) use hierarchies and requirements relations to manage evolving requirements structures.
% 5G) use prioritization to focus improvements of specification quality and elicitation efforts for a well motivated subset of requirements.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%--------------- Specification Techniques ---------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Several different specification techniques (e.g. context diagrams, features, virtual windows, task descriptions).

% 3A) apply more than one suitable specification technique (e.g. task descriptions and screen prototypes)
% 4B) use at least four different specification techniques adequately tailored to the context.
% 3B) define a system’s boundaries and its interaction with external entities.
% 5A) combine specification techniques in an explicitly motivated trade off between qualities and costs, where a high degree of specification completeness is achieved for a carefully selected subset of requirements.
% 5C) go beyond initial stakeholders and given frames, while challenging the domain boundaries and eliciting creative ideas and deep domain knowledge in real-world contexts.
\section{Specification Techniques}
\subsection{Context Diagrams}
Figure~\ref{fig:context} shows the context diagram. This diagram shows the interface that the application PostCardBuddy will interact with and the stakeholders who will interact with the application.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%------------------ Release Plan ------------------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% A release plan defining which requirements that are implemented in each of three releases, namely R3 (final release for this course project), and the imagined future releases R4 and R5. The release plan shall include information used to derive the plan such as priorities and cost.
% The requirements planned for R3 (in the release plan) should be implemented as mock-up designs (e.g. screens and prototypes, analog drawings, clickable presentations, executable gui mockups) and thus included in the final (R3) release.

% 4H) create a release plan for a subset of prioritized features, while taking into account precedence constraints.
% 5F) combine priorities from several stakeholders and use priorities and scheduling constraints to iteratively create a relevant release plan.
