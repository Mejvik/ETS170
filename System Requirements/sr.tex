\section{Introduction}
This document is written within the context of the course Requirements Engineering at Lund Institute of Technology, which the authors are currently enrolled in. The authors have been provided with a project mission from another group, specifying a product they want to see developed. This group has also acted as the key customer. The intention of this document is to specify the requirements of this product, namely PostcardBuddy.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------%
%---------------------- Background ---------------------------------%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Extend background from PMv2
\section{Background}
The process of sending postcards is time consuming and somewhat tedious. The product described in this document aims to solve this problem by providing an easy and efficient way to send personalized postcards directly from a smart phone. Simply choose an image for the front of the postcard, add a greeting on the back and send it to your friends and family. The image for the front can be a photo to capture a moment, an image from the phone's gallery or a template image. The template images can be found in the applications standard gallery. When the user presses the send button in the application the postcard is sent to a printer. The postcard is then delivered to the postal service for further forwarding to the final recipient. 

%Everybody likes receiving postcards, but the process of sending them is tedious and takes too much effort. This is what PostcardBuddy hopes to change. PostcardBuddy is a mobile application that will simplify the process, whether you want to be creative and design your own postcards or make it easy for yourself and use a template postcard based on your location and send it to everyone in your contact list. 
%
%The application is perfect for every occasion you want to send a postcard. Grandma's birthday is coming up? Send a postcard of you and your cousins! Christmas is around the corner? Send everyone in your contact list a postcard of your cats! Away on vacation? Why not send a ready-made postcard that shows off the amazing beach to everyone in the office? Nobody needs to know it rained all week. 
%
%PostcardBuddy is the perfect tool when you want to let someone know you are thinking of them, no matter the occasion.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%----------------- System Requirements ------------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Different types of system requirements (e.g. data, function, quality) at different levels (e.g. goal, domain, product, design).
% Each requirement should have a unique identity (name or number) that is consistent between releases.
% A subset of the requirements should be prioritized.

% 3A) more than two types of requirement (e.g. data, function, quality), and more than three abstraction levels (e.g. goal, domain, product, design) 
% 4A) combine different degrees of completeness and different levels of abstraction
% 4C) provide explicit requirements rationale that reduce risks of misinterpretation.
% 4D) use hierarchies and requirements relations to manage evolving requirements structures.
% 5G) use prioritization to focus improvements of specification quality and elicitation efforts for a well motivated subset of requirements.

\section{System Requirements}

\subsection{Goal}
The product aims to establish the key customer in the postcard sending market and shall achieve this through the following goals:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Simplify the process of sending postcards \label{goal:simpl}
\item Enable user to send personalized postcards \label{goal:pers}
\item Enable revenue generation for the printer of postcards \label{goal:rev}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
This section describes the functions and features of the application.

\subsubsection{Domain}
The domain level requirements provides information about how PostcardBuddy interacts with its surroundings. 

\paragraph{Context Diagram}
The context diagram of the product can be found in figure~\ref{fig:context}. This diagram shows the environment of the product and the stakeholders interacting with it. The demarcation between the inner and outer domain is based on whether the interaction with PostcardBuddy is direct. For example the printer is in the inner domain because the developer will have to take this interface into account when constructing the product. 

There is one stakeholders that will interact directly with the application, namely the mobile user. The mobile user will use the application for creating personalized postcards. For the front of the postcard the user shall be able to select an image from the application's standard gallery. These images will be provided through an image database. The specification of the image database is out of the scope of this document. Images are provided to the database by a \textit{Supplier of images}.

Some of the features of the product will require the use of functionality already present in the the device. The camera will be used to enable the user to take a picture. The GPS will provide the location of the user. The contacts will be used to select recipients. Finally the E-mail functionality in the device will be used when sending E-cards.
 
When a user sends a physical postcard it will be sent to a printer. The  \textit{Printer of postcards} has access to the printer and delivers the postcard to the postal service.  Finally the postal service delivers the physical post card to the final recipients. \textit{Printer of postcards} is responsible for a franking agreement with the postal service.

When sending physical postcards the user will be charged through a standard payment solution integrated in the product. The charge includes both the cost of the physical postcard and the franking.

\paragraph{Stakeholders}
Selected stakeholders for PostcardBuddy are presented in Table~\ref{table:stakeholder}. For each stakeholder there is a number to visualize the prioritization. The scale is from 1-5 where 1 represent a high priority and 5 a low priority.


\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\label{table:deliv}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
\textbf{Stakeholder} & \textbf{Priority} \\
\hline
Mobile user & 1\\
\hline
Printer of postcards & 2\\
\hline
Postal service & 2\\
\hline
Developers & 3\\
\hline
Payment service & 4\\
\hline
The existing application \textit{Riktiga Vykort} & 4\\
\hline

\end{tabular}\\
\caption{Stakeholder prioritization}
\label{table:stakeholder}
\end{table}

\begin{description}
\item[Mobile user] was given the highest priority since they will be the actual users of the product and without them there will be no market.
\item[Printer of postcards] will act as the key customer, since they placed the order of the product, and are thereby given a high priority. 
\item[Postal service] was given a high priority because they are considered a possible buyer of the application in the future. 
\item[Developers] are given a medium priority since they have knowledge about whether a functionality is reasonable or not from a technical perspective.
\item[Payment service] was given a low priority as the payment service will be used only to provide the application with a standardized pay-functionality and is replaceable.
\item[The existing application \textit{Riktiga Vykort}]  is a competitor to the application and has only been used for comparison and is hence given a low priority.

\subsection{Quality Requirements}



\subsubsection{Quality grid}
This quality grid seen in table~\ref{tab:qg} highlights quality factors for certain identified elements. Elements not in the grid can be seen as having status "As usual". Numbers in the quality grid are references to the numbers below the grid. The "x" does not have a reference.

\begin{enumerate}
\item PostcardBuddy uses an integrated payment solution for sending physical postcards. Integrity/Security shall be as usual for an application that contains an integrated payment solution.
\item Many users may use PostcardBuddy when they are on vacation. Therefore it is important the application will work in a wide geographical area while still being reliable. Users sending digital, or physical, postcards not coming through will not be pleased.
\item The standard user might just send a few postcards a year. Because of this it is critical that the application is easy to use. Users should not need to go through unnecessary menus and steps. It should be quick and easy to create a postcard and press "send".
\item Internet connection when on vacation is often a problem. It is therefore critical that PostcardBuddy has a low internet demand. Some users might only use PostcardBuddy on their vacation.
\item Users may install PostcardBuddy while on their vacation. Internet connection might be weak and disconnects from internet could be common. Also users might need to leave internet zones for trips on their vacation.
\item PostcardBuddy saves files to the smartphone and uses features as the phone's camera and gallery.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{QUPER}
A Quper diagram takes into consideration quality and performance. In this Quper diagram we measured time from requesting access to a specific image in the standard gallery, to the image being loaded into creating a postcard. For the competitor, "Riktiga Vykort", this was done twenty times with different pictures. 
Competitor, "Riktiga Vykort", was measured with a OnePlus One smartphone. The targeted area for PostcardBuddy should be done with the same kind of smartphone and tested in as a similar way as possible. For PostcardBuddy it would not be a disaster if it would do better then the Best Case. It is simply there to communicate that it does not need to do better as users would probably not care. It could also be seen as it is not worth, in context of costs and trade-offs, to do better.
See figure~\ref{fig:quper}.

	\item [Req \thesubsubsection {.\theperf} User interface speed] In 95~\% of the cases, the user interface shall respond within 200~ms after a finished user interaction, if there should be an response. 

	\stepcounter{perf}
	\item [Req \thesubsubsection {.\theperf} Memory] The application shall use less than 300~MB RAM when editing an 8~MP image with all tools used consecutively 50 times.
	\stepcounter{perf}
	\item [Req \thesubsubsection {.\theperf} Picture quality] The camera shall be able to take a picture in the highest hardware supported resolution. 
	\begin{description}
	 \item[Clarification:] This requirement applies to the latest iPhone/Nexus, at the time of release for the application e.g. iPhone~6S (plus) and Nexus 6P/5X at 10/12/15.
	 \end{description}
	\stepcounter{perf}
	\item [Req \thesubsubsection {.\theperf} Autofocus] The camera shall have an autofocus that is comparable to the Android/iOS stock camera. Within 95~\% of the cases, the time to focus shall not take more than 0.5~s longer than the stock camera and the focus plane distance must be within 20~\% of the stock camera if the distance is less than 10~m. The motive should be well lit and have good contrast so that the stock camera can find the same focus five times. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Maintainability/Portability}
The following requirements are related to maintainability and portability of product and support goal~\ref{goal:simpl}.

\newcounter{mapo}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%--------------- Specification Techniques ---------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Several different specification techniques (e.g. context diagrams, features, virtual windows, task descriptions).

% 3A) apply more than one suitable specification technique (e.g. task descriptions and screen prototypes)
% 4B) use at least four different specification techniques adequately tailored to the context.
% 3B) define a system‚Äôs boundaries and its interaction with external entities.
% 5A) combine specification techniques in an explicitly motivated trade off between qualities and costs, where a high degree of specification completeness is achieved for a carefully selected subset of requirements.
% 5C) go beyond initial stakeholders and given frames, while challenging the domain boundaries and eliciting creative ideas and deep domain knowledge in real-world contexts.


%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
%------------------ Release Plan ------------------------------------%
%--------------------------------------------------------------------%
% A release plan defining which requirements that are implemented in each of three releases, namely R3 (final release for this course project), and the imagined future releases R4 and R5. The release plan shall include information used to derive the plan such as priorities and cost.
% The requirements planned for R3 (in the release plan) should be implemented as mock-up designs (e.g. screens and prototypes, analog drawings, clickable presentations, executable gui mockups) and thus included in the final (R3) release.

% 4H) create a release plan for a subset of prioritized features, while taking into account precedence constraints.
% 5F) combine priorities from several stakeholders and use priorities and scheduling constraints to iteratively create a relevant release plan.
